                The Foundation holds 4.5% of Vyarnaâ€™s equity. It is not divided.
                It is not sold. It is protected for future distribution by the
                people who created the value in the first place: verified milk
                providers.
                {"\n\n"}
                That distribution does not begin immediately. It is deferred
                until a future liquidity event â€” such as an IPO or major
                investor exit. This protects early investors, especially
                individuals who took personal financial risks. A $2,000
                investment from a working mother often represents months of
                savings. A $200,000 investment from a venture firm rarely does.
                {"\n\n"}
                Until that point, the equity remains in trust. The Foundation
                operates with stewardship, not control. The value is preserved â€”
                not extracted â€” and no dividends are issued.
                {"\n\n"}
                The current governance framework is open for review. Anyone â€”
                especially future beneficiaries â€” can read the full structural
                document and propose amendments. All suggestions are publicly
                logged and must be reviewed by the Foundation's provisional
                Structural Committee.

            initialText={`# Silvia ChavarrÃ­a GonzÃ¡lez Foundation â€“ Governing Charter

## 1. Purpose of the Foundation

The Silvia ChavarrÃ­a GonzÃ¡lez Foundation exists to hold and steward equity in Vyarna on behalf of verified women who have shared their breast milk through the Vyarna system. It ensures that this equity is governed transparently, redistributed ethically, and used to uplift the needs and priorities of milk providers worldwide.

---

## 2. Scope of Stewardship

- The Foundation holds 4.5% equity in Vyarna.
- This equity is not divided or distributed until a liquidity event (e.g. IPO or acquisition).
- The Foundation does not issue dividends or use the equity for operational expenses.
- The equity is safeguarded in trust for verified milk providers who participate in the Vyarna ecosystem.

---

## 3. Structure of Representation

### a. Pods
- The base unit is a **Pod**: a group of 9 verified milk providers in geographic or thematic proximity.
- Each Pod receives its own operating budget.
- Pods are autonomous in deciding how to use their budget and which priorities to pursue.
- Each Pod elects a representative.

### b. DecaPods
- 10 Pods = 1 DecaPod (90 providers).
- DecaPods manage coordination at the local-regional level.
- Each DecaPod elects one representative to the CentoPod.

### c. CentoPods
- 10 DecaPods = 1 CentoPod (900 providers).
- CentoPods aggregate regional priorities and enable scale negotiations.
- Each CentoPod elects one representative to the MegaPod.

### d. MegaPods
- 10 CentoPods = 1 MegaPod (9,000 providers).
- MegaPods are the highest layer of regional coordination.
- Each MegaPod has its own budget and governance protocol.
- Each MegaPod elects one representative to the Foundationâ€™s **Global Congress**.

### e. Global Congress
- The Global Congress is composed of one representative per MegaPod.
- This body holds final authority over equity governance, amendments to this Charter, and all cross-regional decisions.

---

## 4. Amendment Process

- This Charter is a living document.
- Any verified provider may propose edits via the Foundationâ€™s public wiki.
- Proposed edits are reviewed by the **Structural Review Committee** until full provider governance is in place.

**Current Committee Members:**
- [Juan Carlos Mendoza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcmendozagarcia/)
- [Karla CÃ³rdoba-Brenes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muguika/)
- [Pedro Alvarado-ChavarrÃ­a](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedroalvaradochavarria/)

- Once provider participation reaches quorum, future amendments will be voted on by the Global Congress.

---

## 5. Eligibility to Benefit

- Any woman who has verifiably shared breast milk through the Vyarna system may become a beneficiary.
- No further action is required to maintain beneficiary status.
- Geography, income level, or continued participation do not affect eligibility.
- All beneficiary records are managed transparently via the Vyarna platform.

---

## 6. Guiding Principles

- Equity is held in trust, not in ownership.
- Governance begins at the grassroots level and builds upward.
- All voting and financial decisions are logged and auditable.
- Respect, transparency, and participation are non-negotiable values.
