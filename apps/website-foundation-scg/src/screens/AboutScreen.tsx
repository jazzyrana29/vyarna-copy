                  {"\n\n"}Silvia was born in 1952. She was a Costa Rican
                  mathematician, one of the first women in her field at the

                  Applied Mathematics from Rice University in 1978 ‚Äî at a time
                  when ‚Äúapplied mathematics‚Äù meant computing.
                  {"\n\n"}She returned to Costa Rica and became one of the
                  founding members of the UCR School of Computer Science.

                  in Gender and Cognition from the University of Wisconsin ‚Äî and

                  political reform was in her blood. Silvia spent her life
                  dismantling unjust hierarchies, not reinforcing them.
                  {"\n\n"}She faced gender bias her entire career, especially in
                  male-dominated fields like mathematics and software. She never

                Pedro Alvarado-Chavarr√≠a is a founder, a father, and a systems
                thinker. Vyarna wasn‚Äôt an abstract biotech vision ‚Äî it was a
                personal mission.
                {"\n\n"}He wanted his own children to have access to the
                benefits of breast milk, even though they didn‚Äôt receive it as
                babies. That gap sparked the product. But the deeper motivation
                was more radical: What if a for-profit company could be wired to
                support non-profit structures, permanently?
                {"\n\n"}Pedro doesn‚Äôt want to become a billionaire. He wants to
                build a successful business that earns money ‚Äî and distributes
                it justly. A company that grows on capitalist terms, but returns
                its gains to the people who made them possible.
                {"\n\n"}That‚Äôs what the Foundation exists to do. Not to perform
                generosity, but to operationalize fairness.
                {"\n\n"}And that‚Äôs why its structure isn‚Äôt frozen. As providers
                join, they will be invited ‚Äî systematically ‚Äî to co-author the
                rules that govern their own collective future.

                  The Foundation now holds 4.5% of Vyarna‚Äôs equity. That equity
                  is non-dilutable, cannot be sold, and is governed by bylaws
                  that prevent misuse. The shares are not held for executives or
                  institutions. They are held for one group only: verified milk
                  providers.
                  {"\n\n"}The current design includes a Pod-based voting
                  structure that can scale as providers join. But that design is
                  not final. It is provisional‚Äîmeant to evolve with real
                  feedback.
                  {"\n\n"}As soon as providers are onboarded into Vyarna, they
                  will be invited to participate in the design of their own
                  governance. That is not a promise. It‚Äôs a protocol.
