                  The Silvia ChavarrÃ­a GonzÃ¡lez Foundation does not currently
                  hold shares in Vyarna. The equity is held in trust by Pedro
                  Alvarado-ChavarrÃ­a, founder of Vyarna, with a legal and moral
                  commitment to transfer it to the Foundation.
                  {"\n\n"}
                  That transfer will occur after an early investor exitâ€”such as
                  an IPO or buyoutâ€”when the earliest risk-takers have had a
                  chance to realize returns.
                  {"\n\n"}
                  No shares will be assigned to individuals. They will be
                  transferred to the Foundation as a legal entity, which will
                  govern them in line with its Charterâ€”for the benefit of
                  verified milk providers.

                The Foundationâ€™s future shareholder role is not ceremonial. It
                will hold voting rights, approve dividends, and influence
                Vyarnaâ€™s direction. But these rights must be exercised wisely.
                {"\n\n"}
                We believe in a for-profit structure that fuels nonprofit
                outcomes. Vyarna must succeed commercially for the Foundation to
                distribute long-term value.
                {"\n\n"}
                Governance will be guided by strategy, not slogans. We aim to
                demonstrate what ethical capitalism looks like when built to
                redistributeâ€”not extractâ€”wealth.

                  The equity transfer to the Foundation is contractual and

                  {"\n\n"}
                  We are preparing for that future now: building bylaws,
                  reviewing scenarios, and engaging future stakeholders.
                  {"\n\n"}
                  Once the shares arrive, the Foundation will be readyâ€”not just
                  to receive them, but to steward them.
