                The Silvia ChavarrÃ­a GonzÃ¡lez Foundation was created with one
                purpose: to serve the needs of verified breast milk providers.
                But instead of assuming what those needs are, weâ€™ve chosen a
                different path.
                {"\n\n"}
                We are building the programs{" "}
                <Text className="font-semibold">with you, not for you</Text>.
                {"\n\n"}
                We believe real support starts with listening. Thatâ€™s why the
                Foundation has not pre-selected a fixed set of benefits or
                services. Instead, we are actively gathering feedback from
                providers, researchers, and health professionals to shape a set
                of offerings that are practical, respectful, and
                provider-driven.

                Until the full governance model is activated, you can help shape
