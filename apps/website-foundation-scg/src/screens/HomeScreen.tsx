                  visibility and acknowledgment to long-term equity and
                  participatory governance, the Foundation ensures that
                  providers are not forgotten once the milk is collected. They
                  remain at the center of the story.

                  The beneficiaries of the Foundation are exclusively those
                  individuals who have provided verified breast milk to Vyarna.
                  Eligibility is determined through transparent internal
                  contribution records and testing protocols. No future
                  participation is required to retain beneficiary status. No one
                  is excluded based on geography, income, or continued

                  All verified providers are treated with equal standing. Every
                  program, service, and governance right is built around one
                  idea: that milk provision is not just a biological act ‚Äî it is
                  an economic and ethical one. And it deserves a structure to
                  match.
