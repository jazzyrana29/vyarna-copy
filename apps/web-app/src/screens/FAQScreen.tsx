        question: "What is Vyarna?",
        answer:
          "Vyarna is a breast milk booster made from verified, freeze-dried human milk. It adds microbiome and immune benefits to formula, solids, or mixed feeding routines.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is this a formula replacement?",
        answer:
          "No. Vyarna is not a formulaâ€”it is real human milk in concentrated powder form. You add it to whatever feeding method you already use.",
      },
      {
        question: "Whatâ€™s in a Vyarna Booster?",
        answer:

      },
      {
        question: "Is Vyarna pasteurized?",
        answer:
          "No. Vyarna uses freeze-drying instead of heat-based pasteurization to preserve key bioactive components that might otherwise be lost.",

      },
      {
        question: "How do I know it's safe?",
        answer:

      },
      {
        question: "What kind of testing is done on the milk?",
        answer:

    items: [
      {
        question: "Where does the milk come from?",
        answer:
          "All milk comes from verified, screened mothers who pass strict safety criteria. Each batch is tested, tracked, and traceable.",
      },
      {
        question: "How is Vyarna different from donor milk?",
        answer:
          "Vyarna is made from milk sourced from verified providers, not anonymous donors. It is freeze-dried, tested for safety, and blended for consistent quality and microbiome diversity.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do you compensate your milk providers?",
        answer:

      },
      {
        question: "Can I use Vyarna with formula-fed babies?",

      },
      {
        question: "Can I breastfeed and still use Vyarna?",

      {
        question: "What makes Vyarna shelf-stable?",
        answer:
          "Vyarna uses a gentle freeze-drying process that removes moisture without damaging milk's sensitive bioactive elements. Thatâ€™s what keeps it stable without preservatives.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need to mix Vyarna with warm water?",
        answer:
